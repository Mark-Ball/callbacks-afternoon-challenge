# Callbacks afternoon challenge

The objective of the challenge was to use a callback. One function (parseRandomUser) would contain the logic to parse the JSON retrieved from a second function (getRandomUser).

Then getRandomUser would be called using parseRandomUser as a callback. In this simple implementation, the user's title, first name, and last name are retrieved from the JSON and printed to the console.
